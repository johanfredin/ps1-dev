            <!-- Sample DA audio file entry.

            DA files SHOULD be put last in the ISO file system or your ISO image may be corrupt.
            These files do not exists in the data track, but are just links to CDDA audio tracks.
            A DA file must have a trackid that matches with with a <track>. The trackid is just a
            string.

            You can still use <track> elements after this, if you want to add further audio tracks
            that are not referenced by any DA file in the data track.
