# About #

Collection of hello world projects for the ps1 runnign a "modern" version of the [psy-q sdk](https://www.retroreversing.com/official-playstation-1-software-development-kit-(psyq)/) originally developed by Psygnosis in 1993. Migrated from initial 
[psx-dev](https://github.com/johanfredin/psx-dev) project. The old project ran the old psyq setup with the original 16bit binaries and (without a big headache) required either a 32 bit windows or using third party libs to be able to run on a 64bit os. Not the most user friendly experience.

This project runs a more modern setup (courtesy of the [psx.dev community](https://www.psx.dev/)) and no longer requires the old 16bit libraries, or windows
to compile!
